# Canon RF 5.2mm Dual Fisheye - Real User Insights

**Research Date:** 2025-12-07
**Purpose:** Learn from real Canon VR180 users to optimize Blender workflow

---

## Overview

Analysis of real-world Canon RF 5.2mm f/2.8 L Dual Fisheye user experiences, workflows, and pain points to inform our Blender VR180 implementation. We can solve many of their problems and learn from their best practices.

---

## Canon EOS VR Workflow (Their Process)

### Step 1: Capture
- Shoot with Canon R5/R5C + RF 5.2mm Dual Fisheye lens
- Records side-by-side fisheye to single sensor (no stitching needed)
- Outputs Canon RAW (CRM) or H.265 files
- Uses camera's gyroscope for stabilization data

### Step 2: Convert (EOS VR Utility)
- **Software:** Canon EOS VR Utility or Adobe Premiere Plugin
- **Process:** Convert fisheye to equirectangular SBS
- **Output:** Apple ProRes 422/4444 or HEVC 4:4:4 10-bit

### Step 3: Edit
- Import into DaVinci Resolve, Premiere Pro, or Final Cut Pro
- Color grade (usually Canon Log 3)
- Edit timeline

### Step 4: Export & Upload
- Export as H.265 with VR180 metadata
- Upload to YouTube/Meta Quest

---

## Major Pain Points (What Users Struggle With)

### 1. Extremely Long Processing Times ⚠️

**Problem:**
- 2-minute 8K RAW video = 50GB file
- Processing can take **9 hours on older computers**
- Even on fast machines: 20+ minutes for 2 minutes of footage
- 3-minute 8K RAW (43GB) → 3+ hours conversion → 100GB output

**User Quote:**
> "Close absolutely everything down before running VR Utilities - even having Chrome open makes things slower"

**Impact:**
- Workflow bottleneck
- Makes iteration slow
- Requires powerful computers
- Discourages experimentation

**🎯 Blender Advantage:**
We don't have this problem! Blender renders directly to final format with metadata injection. No separate conversion step needed.

---

### 2. Massive File Sizes

**Problem:**
- 2 minutes of 8K RAW = 50GB
- Converted files even larger (100GB+)
- Requires fast external drives
- USB drives too slow - need Thunderbolt

**User Recommendations:**
- 32GB RAM (16GB absolute minimum, not Canon's stated 8GB)
- Fast SSD storage (NVMe recommended)
- Close all background apps during processing

**🎯 Blender Advantage:**
We can render at final resolution directly to H.265, skipping intermediate ProRes step. Smaller files throughout workflow.

---

### 3. Required Corrections

Canon EOS VR Utility provides these corrections (users must manually enable):

#### Parallax Correction ✅ **Always Recommended**
- Uses computer vision to adjust pixel height between left/right eyes
- Compensates for minor lens misalignments
- **User advice:** Always check this option

**🎯 Blender Advantage:**
Perfect alignment by default (CG cameras always perfectly aligned). No correction needed!

#### Horizontal Leveling (Gyroscope Data)
- Uses camera's inertial sensor to level footage
- Fixes horizon tilt

**User feedback:**
> "A bubble level on a tripod may be more reliable than consumer-grade sensors"

**🎯 Blender Application:**
- We should add "level check" warning if camera isn't level
- Add visual indicator in viewport (horizon line)
- Make keeping camera level easier

#### Chromatic Aberration Correction
- Removes purple/green fringing from lens
- Requires R5 C firmware 1.0.7.1+
- Bug in EOS VR Utility 1.4.0 (must process clips individually)

**🎯 Blender Advantage:**
CG doesn't have chromatic aberration! Perfectly clean images. No correction needed.

#### Image Stabilization
- Turn OFF for tripod footage
- Turn ON (trackability mode) for gimbal footage

**🎯 Blender Application:**
- We don't need stabilization (CG is always stable)
- But we can add camera shake simulation if desired

---

### 4. Metadata Injection Challenges

**Problem:**
- Users must manually mark footage as "VR180 stereoscopic side-by-side"
- Metadata must be burned into file before YouTube upload
- If missed, video displays as flat 2D

**Workflow:**
1. Export from editor
2. Open in Spatial Media Metadata Injector
3. Check "180°" and "Stereoscopic 3D (left-right)"
4. Save new file with metadata
5. Upload to YouTube

**🎯 Blender Advantage:**
**We solve this completely!** Our automated metadata injection means users never have to think about it. One-click export to YouTube-ready file.

---

### 5. Software Ecosystem Lock-In

**Problem:**
- Requires Canon EOS VR Utility (proprietary)
- Or Adobe Premiere Plugin (Adobe ecosystem only)
- Can't edit raw fisheye in DaVinci/Premiere/FCP directly
- Premiere Plugin often doesn't work or crashes

**User frustrations:**
- Plugin not registering with R5 C
- Crashes and errors
- Limited to Adobe ecosystem

**🎯 Blender Advantage:**
Open-source, cross-platform, no proprietary lock-in. Works on Windows, Mac, Linux.

---

## Best Practices (What Works Well)

### Optimal Subject Distance: 3-15 feet

**User recommendation:**
> "Subjects generally look best positioned between 3 and 15 feet from the camera - close enough to engage with but far enough to look pleasing"

**Why:**
- **Too close (<3ft):** Excessive parallax, eye strain, unnatural depth
- **3-15ft (sweet spot):** Natural depth, comfortable viewing, engaging
- **Too far (>15ft):** Depth becomes less noticeable, loses 3D effect

**🎯 Blender Application:**
- Add subject distance guidelines to docs
- Include "comfort zone" visual indicator in viewport
- Suggest optimal camera-to-subject distances in presets
- Add IPD adjustment recommendations based on distance

---

### Camera Settings (Real-World)

**From Canon Users:**

**For R7 + RF-S 3.9mm:**
- 4K 30p (highest image quality)
- HDR PQ disabled with dual fisheye lens

**For R5/R5C:**
- 8K RAW for maximum quality (but huge files)
- Canon Log 3 gamma (NOT Canon Log 2)
- Record gyroscope data for stabilization

**🎯 Blender Application:**
- Our default: 5.7K (2880×2880 per eye) @ 60fps
- Offer 4K, 5.7K, 8K presets
- Color space: sRGB default, Canon Log 3 option for matching real footage

---

### Post-Processing Workflow

**What works:**
1. **Convert in batches** while sleeping/overnight
2. **Use proxies** for editing (lower res versions)
3. **Color grade in Log** then convert to Rec.709
4. **Export high bitrate** (100Mbps minimum for H.265)

**What doesn't work:**
- Trying to edit during conversion (slows everything)
- Using USB drives (too slow)
- Skipping metadata injection step

**🎯 Blender Application:**
- Render directly to final format (no conversion step)
- Optional proxy rendering for preview
- Built-in color management
- Automatic metadata injection

---

## Technical Specifications Used

### Resolution & Frame Rates

**Most Common:**
- 5.7K 30fps (R5)
- 8K 30fps (R5, R5C)
- 4K 60fps (when motion matters)

**YouTube Upload:**
- Usually 5.7K or 4K

**For YouTube:**
- Final export: H.265/HEVC
- Bitrate: 100Mbps minimum
- Color: Rec.709 or Rec.2020

**🎯 Blender Direct Export:**
- Skip ProRes intermediate step
- Render directly to H.265 @ 100Mbps
- Huge time savings

- Avoid: <3 feet (eye strain) or >20 feet (minimal depth)
```

**In Add-on:**
- Distance measurement tool
- Visual "comfort zone" indicator
- IPD recommendations based on subject distance

---

### 2. Add Camera Level Check

**Visual Indicator:**
- Horizon line overlay in viewport

- Lock rotation X/Y, allow Z only (panning)

---

### 3. Color Space Options

**Presets:**
- sRGB (default, web/YouTube)
- Rec.709 (video standard)

## Key Takeaways

1. **We solve their biggest pain point:** No conversion step, automatic metadata
2. **We have technical advantages:** Perfect alignment, no lens artifacts, unlimited resolution
3. **We should add their best practices:** Subject distance guidelines (3-15ft sweet spot)
4. **We can be faster:** Direct render vs hours of conversion
5. **We're more flexible:** Change any setting and re-render

**Our workflow is objectively better for CG VR180 content!**

The only advantage real cameras have: capturing real-world footage. For everything else (CG, animation, visualization), Blender VR180 workflow is superior.
