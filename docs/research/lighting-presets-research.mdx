## 1. PRODUCT (E-commerce Clean)

### Purpose
Clean, professional product photography for e-commerce listings, catalogs, and marketing materials.

### Industry Standard
Classic 3-point lighting with emphasis on even illumination and minimal shadows.

### Configuration

**Key Light (Main)**
- Position: 45° angle from camera, front-right-top
- Type: Area light
- Energy: 300 (Blender units)
- Size: 5-6 (moderate soft)
- Purpose: Primary illumination, defines form

**Fill Light**
- Position: Opposite side of key (front-left)
- Type: Area light
- Energy: 180 (60% of key)
- Size: 8-10 (very soft)
- Purpose: Reduce shadows, reveal detail

**Rim Light (Back)**
- Position: Behind-top, opposite key
- Type: Area light
- Energy: 200 (70% of key)
- Size: 4-5 (moderate)
- Purpose: Separate from background, add depth

### Key Ratios
- Key : Fill : Rim = 100% : 60% : 70%
- Fill should always be 50-75% of key intensity
- Rim slightly lower to avoid overpowering

### Blender Implementation
```python
# Key light: front-right-top
location = target + Vector((3, -3, 4))
energy = 300
size = 5

# Fill light: front-left
location = target + Vector((-2, -2, 2))
energy = 180
size = 8

# Rim light: behind-top
location = target + Vector((0, 3, 4))
energy = 200
size = 4
```

## 4. DRAMATIC (High Contrast Cinematic)

### Purpose
High-contrast, moody lighting for hero shots, cinematic renders, film noir, and artistic work.

### Industry Standard
Chiaroscuro lighting (Italian: light-dark), low-key technique with single strong source and minimal fill.

### Configuration

**Key Light (Single Strong)**
- Position: Side angle (60-70° from camera)
- Type: Spot light (hard shadows)
- Energy: 1000+ (very strong)
- Spot Size: 60° (focused)
- Purpose: Create dramatic shadows, high contrast

**Fill Light (Minimal)**
- Position: Opposite side, low
- Type: Area light (soft)
- Energy: 80 (8% of key)
- Size: 10 (very soft)
- Purpose: Subtle shadow fill, maintain mystery

### Key Principles
- Single dominant light source
- Hard shadows (minimal diffusion)
- High contrast ratio (12:1 or higher)
- Deep blacks, bright highlights
- Minimal fill (just enough to see shadow detail)

### Advanced Techniques
- Use barn doors to shape light
- Flags/gobos to control spill
- Side lighting for contour emphasis
- Back lighting for silhouette drama

### Blender Implementation
```python
# Key spot light: side angle, strong
location = target + Vector((5, -5, 6))
type = 'SPOT'
energy = 1000
spot_size = math.radians(60)

# Minimal fill: opposite, very soft
location = target + Vector((-3, -2, 2))
type = 'AREA'
energy = 80
size = 10
```

## 5. TECHNICAL (Flat Shadowless)

### Purpose
Technical drawings, CAD visualization, isometric renders, blueprints, documentation where shadows are unwanted.

### Industry Standard
Single large overhead light or symmetrical dual-source setup for completely even, shadowless illumination.

### Configuration

**Overhead Area Light (Single)**
- Position: Directly above (0, 0, 20)
- Type: Area light (very large)
- Energy: 500
- Size: 20 (extremely large)
- Purpose: Uniform flat lighting, no shadows

### Alternative: Dual Symmetrical Setup
```
Light 1: Front-right-top (3, -3, 15)
Light 2: Front-left-top (-3, -3, 15)
Both: Energy 300, Size 15
```

### Key Principles
- No falloff (even intensity across scene)
- Large source = soft/no shadows
- Overhead position eliminates side shadows
- Equal lighting from all visible angles
- Mimics "infinity light" in CAD programs

### Blender Implementation
```python
# Single overhead
location = (0, 0, 20)
type = 'AREA'
energy = 500
size = 20

# Or dual symmetrical
positions = [(3, -3, 15), (-3, -3, 15)]
for pos in positions:
    energy = 300
    size = 15
```

### Additional Settings
- Consider disabling shadows entirely for pure flat lighting
- Use very high ambient occlusion samples for subtle depth
- Viewport shading can use "Flat" mode for preview

## 6. OUTDOOR (Sun + Sky Simulation)

### Purpose
Natural outdoor lighting for architectural visualization, environment renders, and outdoor scenes.

### Industry Standard
Directional sun light combined with sky environment texture or gradient background.

### Configuration

**Sun Light**
- Position: Angled 45-60° elevation, from side
- Type: Sun (directional, infinite distance)
- Energy: 5.0 (Blender sun strength)
- Angle: 0.545° (realistic sun angular size)
- Color: Slight warm (temp ~5500K)

**Sky Environment**
- World shader with Sky Texture node
- Sun Position addon for accurate time/location
- Or simple gradient: horizon blue → zenith lighter blue

**Fill/Bounce (Optional)**
- Subtle area light from ground level
- Energy: 50-100
- Color: Slight blue (sky bounce)
- Purpose: Simulate ground/environment reflection

### Sun Angle Guidelines
- **Morning/Evening**: 15-30° elevation, warm color (3500K)
- **Midday**: 60-80° elevation, neutral white (5500K)
- **Afternoon**: 45° elevation, slight warm (4500K)

### Key Principles
- Sun from side creates depth and shadow detail
- Overhead sun is flat and unflattering
- Sky provides ambient fill naturally
- Proper sun elevation critical for realism

### Blender Implementation
```python
# Create sun light
bpy.ops.object.light_add(type='SUN', location=(0, 0, 10))
sun = context.active_object
sun.data.energy = 5.0
sun.data.angle = math.radians(0.545)  # Realistic sun size

# Rotate for 45° elevation, from side
sun.rotation_euler = (math.radians(45), 0, math.radians(-45))

# World sky texture (simplified)
world = bpy.context.scene.world
world.use_nodes = True
nodes = world.node_tree.nodes
sky_texture = nodes.new(type='ShaderNodeTexSky')
# Connect to Background shader
```

### Advanced: Time of Day
```python
# Golden hour (sunrise/sunset)
sun.data.energy = 4.0
sun.rotation_euler.x = math.radians(15)  # Low angle
sun.data.color = (1.0, 0.9, 0.7)  # Warm

# Noon (harsh)
sun.data.energy = 6.0
sun.rotation_euler.x = math.radians(75)  # High angle
sun.data.color = (1.0, 1.0, 1.0)  # Neutral
```

## 7. BACKLIGHT (Rim/Edge Focus)

### Purpose
Emphasize subject outline, create separation from background, dramatic silhouettes, and edge definition.

### Industry Standard
Strong backlighting with minimal frontal fill, creating "halo" or rim effect around subject edges.

### Configuration

**Primary Rim Light**
- Position: Behind subject, slightly to side
- Type: Area light
- Energy: 300
- Size: 4-5 (moderate hard)
- Purpose: Create main edge light

**Secondary Rim Light (Opposite)**
- Position: Behind, opposite side
- Type: Area light
- Energy: 200
- Size: 4-5
- Purpose: Complete the rim on both edges

**Fill Light (Minimal Front)**
- Position: Front, low and soft
- Type: Area light
- Energy: 50 (very low)
- Size: 10 (very soft)
- Purpose: Just enough to reveal front detail

### Key Principles
- Rim lights should be 1/3 power of typical key light
- Position slightly to side (not directly behind)
- Angle downward for "halo" effect
- Bright enough to overpower ambient
- Works best with dark backgrounds (contrast)

### Intensity Guidelines
- **Subtle rim**: 1/3 of key light power
- **Dramatic rim**: Equal to or brighter than key
- **Pure silhouette**: No front fill at all

### Blender Implementation
```python
# Primary rim: behind-right
location = target + Vector((3, 4, 5))
type = 'AREA'
energy = 300
size = 4
# Angle downward toward subject

# Secondary rim: behind-left
location = target + Vector((-3, 4, 5))
energy = 200
size = 4

# Minimal front fill
location = target + Vector((0, -5, 1))
energy = 50
size = 10
```

### Advanced Techniques
- **Edge Light**: Move rim to exact side (90°) for contour lighting
- **Hair Light**: Position higher, smaller size for hair highlight
- **Colored Rim**: Use color gels/filters for creative edge colors
- **Single vs Double**: Single rim = asymmetric drama, double = balanced

## Implementation Notes

### Blender-Specific Considerations

**Energy Values**
- Area lights: 100-500 typical range
- Spot lights: 500-2000 for focused beams
- Sun lights: 1.0-10.0 (different scale)
- Values assume Cycles renderer at default settings

**Light Size**
- Small (2-4): Hard shadows, defined edges
- Medium (5-8): Moderate softness
- Large (10-20): Very soft, wrap-around

**Light Types**
- **AREA**: Most versatile, soft controllable shadows
- **SPOT**: Focused beams, hard shadows, gobos
- **SUN**: Infinite distance directional (outdoor)
- **POINT**: Omnidirectional (avoid for controlled setups)

### Adaptation for Different Cameras

**Orbit Camera**
- Lights rotate with camera automatically
- Use target-relative positioning
- Ensure lights don't intersect camera path

**Isometric Camera**
- Technical preset most common
- Avoid strong shadows (breaks flat aesthetic)
- Consider shadowless options

**VR180/VR360**
- Lights must not be visible in 360° view
- Position far enough away (10m+)
- Use larger sizes for softer shadows at distance

### Color Temperature Reference

```python
# Common light color temperatures
'TUNGSTEN':     (1.0, 0.8, 0.6)   # 3200K - Warm indoor
'DAYLIGHT':     (1.0, 1.0, 1.0)   # 5500K - Neutral
'OVERCAST':     (0.9, 0.95, 1.0)  # 6500K - Cool outdoor
'GOLDEN_HOUR':  (1.0, 0.85, 0.6)  # 3500K - Sunset/sunrise
'BLUE_HOUR':    (0.7, 0.8, 1.0)   # 9000K - Twilight
```

### Testing Presets

When implementing presets:
1. Test on simple cube first (see shadow definition)
2. Test on complex model (character/product)
3. Test with reflective materials (check specular highlights)
4. Test with different backgrounds (light vs dark)
5. Verify no light clipping or artifacts

### User Customization

All presets should be starting points. Users should be able to:
- Adjust overall brightness (multiply all energies)
- Toggle individual lights on/off
- Reposition lights manually
- Change light colors
- Adjust shadow sharpness (light size)

---

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Presets to Consider

**MOODY** (Low-key atmospheric)
- Single dim source
- Heavy shadows
- Optional colored accent lights
- Use: Horror, noir, mystery

**GOLDEN_HOUR** (Warm sunset)
- Low-angle sun (15-20°)
- Warm orange color (3500K)
- Blue opposite fill (sky bounce)
- Use: Cinematic, romantic

**BOUNCE** (Indirect realistic)
- No direct lights visible
- Large area lights as "walls"
- Simulates light bouncing off surfaces
- Use: Realistic indoor, natural

### Advanced Features

- **Light Linking**: Lights affect only certain objects
- **Negative Lights**: Subtract light (shadows without blockers)
- **IES Profiles**: Real-world light distribution patterns
- **HDRI Environments**: Replace presets with real-world lighting
- **Animated Lights**: Time-of-day progression for outdoor
