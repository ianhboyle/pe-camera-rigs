## Concepts & Understanding

### Equirectangular Projection

The standard projection format for 360° video.

**How it works:**
- 360° horizontal (full circle around)
- 180° vertical (from top to bottom)
- 2:1 aspect ratio (width is double height)
- Rectangular image unwraps to sphere

**Why 2:1 ratio:**
```
360° horizontal ÷ 180° vertical = 2:1
```

**Visualization:**
```
Top pole (stretched)
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Equator (normal)  │ ← Natural scale
└─────────────────────┘
Bottom pole (stretched)
```

Poles are stretched horizontally, equator is natural scale.

### Monoscopic vs Stereoscopic

**Monoscopic (This Camera):**
- ✅ Single viewpoint
- ✅ No depth perception
- ✅ Simpler, faster rendering
- ✅ Half the file size
- ✅ No stereo mismatch issues
- ✅ Perfect for environments

**Stereoscopic (VR360 Stereo):**
- Two cameras (left/right eyes)
- Depth perception (3D)
- More complex, slower rendering
- Larger file sizes
- Potential stereo comfort issues
- Better for interactive content

**When to use mono:**
- Environments and locations
- Tours and walkthroughs
- Landscapes and nature
- Architecture and real estate
- Any content where depth is less important

**When to use stereo:**
- Interactive experiences
- Close subject interaction
- Games and simulations
- Content where depth matters

### 360° Coverage

Unlike VR180 (front 180°), VR360 captures **everything**:

**360° means:**
- Viewer can look in **any direction**
- Front, back, left, right, up, down
- No "safe zone" - everything is visible
- Lighting must work from all angles
- No hiding lights, cameras, crew

**Design implications:**
- Can't hide anything behind camera
- Background visible in all directions
- Lighting challenges (360° coverage)
- Props/set must work from all angles

## Best Practices

### Camera Placement

✅ **DO:**
- Keep camera at natural viewpoint (1.6m eye level)
- **Keep camera PERFECTLY level** (critical - no tilt!)
- Use static camera (movement usually unnecessary)
- Position at viewer's natural position
- Check horizon line is level

❌ **DON'T:**
- Tilt camera even slightly (instant motion sickness)
- Move camera rapidly (nauseating in 360°)
- Place camera at awkward heights
- Forget that viewer sees EVERYTHING

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Camera Leveling**

Even **2° tilt** causes viewer discomfort in VR360.

**Why It Matters:**
- Tilted horizon visible in ALL directions
- Cannot be hidden (360° coverage)
- Causes severe motion sickness
- Cannot be fixed in post-processing

**Best Practice:**
- Ensure camera rotation X and Y = 0°
- Only rotate on Z axis (panning) if needed
- Use horizon indicator in viewport
- Add-on warns if camera is tilted

### Content Design for 360°

✅ **DO:**
- Design for 360° viewing (all directions)
- Create points of interest around viewer
- Guide attention with lighting and composition
- Use spatial audio to direct attention
- Think about what's above and below too

❌ **DON'T:**
- Put all content in one direction
- Ignore what's behind viewer
- Use rapid cuts (jarring in VR)
- Forget about zenith and nadir

**Pro Tip:** Place your most important content in front (where viewer starts), but reward exploration in other directions.

### Lighting for 360°

✅ **DO:**
- Use environmental/HDRI lighting
- Hide light sources creatively
- Even, omnidirectional lighting
- Use emissive materials for visible lights
- Consider lighting from all angles

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use visible area lights (hard to hide)
- Create strong directional shadows
- Forget viewer sees 360°
- Use obvious studio lighting

**Lighting Strategies:**
1. **HDRI Environments:** Best for outdoor/natural
2. **Emissive Geometry:** Light sources in scene
3. **Portal Lights:** Windows, doors as light sources
4. **Ambient + Subtle Directional:** Soft overall with subtle direction

### Zenith and Nadir (Top and Bottom)

**The poles of your 360° sphere:**

**Zenith (Top):**
- What viewer sees looking up
- Often sky, ceiling, tree canopy
- Less critical but still visible
- Stretched in equirectangular

**Nadir (Bottom):**
- What viewer sees looking down
- Often ground, floor, water
- **Common issue:** Camera rig visible
- **Solution:** Paint out or use empty floor

**Pro Tip:** Put camera tripod/rig logo at nadir - viewers rarely look straight down, and it's expected.

### Performance

✅ **DO:**
- Use GPU rendering (OptiX/HIP)
- Enable denoising
- Start with Preview preset
- Optimize environment geometry

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use excessive polygon count
- Skip GPU acceleration
- Render full animation without test
- Forget VR360 renders faster than stereo

**Performance Note:** VR360 mono renders approximately **2× faster** than VR180 stereo (only one camera vs. two).

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Video not showing as VR360 on YouTube

**Symptoms:**
- Video plays as flat 2D
- Looks stretched and distorted
- No VR button in YouTube player

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Verify metadata was injected (check add-on log)
2. ✅ Wait up to 1 hour after upload (YouTube processing)
3. ✅ Check resolution is 2:1 ratio (e.g., 7680×3840)
4. ✅ Re-render with "Verify Metadata" option enabled

### Issue: Stretched or distorted poles

**Symptoms:**
- Top and bottom of sphere very stretched
- Objects near poles look weird
- Distortion in equirectangular image

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ **This is normal for equirectangular projection**
2. ✅ Avoid placing important content near poles
3. ✅ Content looks correct in VR headset
4. ✅ Use sphere preview in Blender to check

**Note:** Pole stretching is inherent to equirectangular format. It looks weird as a flat image but correct in VR.

### Issue: Motion sickness reports

**Symptoms:**
- Viewers feel nauseous
- Dizziness
- Disorientation

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Ensure camera is level (no tilt)
2. ✅ Make camera completely static
3. ✅ Increase frame rate to 60fps
4. ✅ Avoid any camera movement
5. ✅ Test in actual VR headset

### Issue: Low quality / blurry in headset

**Symptoms:**
- Blurry when viewed in VR
- Pixelated
- Low detail

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Increase resolution to 7680×3840 (8K)
2. ✅ Use Production or Final render preset
3. ✅ Increase bitrate to 150Mbps+
4. ✅ Wait for YouTube to process high-quality version
5. ✅ 360° spreads pixels over full sphere - higher res needed

**Note:** VR360 needs higher resolution than flat video because pixels are spread over entire sphere.

### Issue: Camera rig visible at nadir

**Symptoms:**
- Tripod/stand visible when looking down
- Objects at camera location visible

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Don't place geometry at camera position
2. ✅ Use empty floor texture
3. ✅ Paint out in post (or Blender compositor)
4. ✅ Place subtle logo/watermark at nadir

## Tips & Tricks

### Getting the Best Quality

1. **8K is standard for VR360** - Lower resolutions look pixelated
2. **60fps minimum** - VR benefits from high frame rates
3. **Static camera** - Movement rarely needed in 360°
4. **Even lighting** - Fewer artifacts, cleaner render
5. **Test in VR headset** - Flat preview doesn't show true quality

### Faster Workflows

1. **VR360 mono is fast** - Single camera, direct render
2. **GPU essential** - 10-20× faster than CPU
3. **Preview renders** - Test 10 frames before full render
4. **Optimize geometry** - Viewer sees everything, but from distance
5. **Reuse environments** - Save as asset library

### Creative Techniques

1. **Reward Exploration** - Place interesting details in all directions
2. **Spatial Audio** - Guide attention with 3D sound
3. **Multiple Viewpoints** - Render from different spots, let viewer choose
4. **Time of Day** - Render same location at different times
5. **Seasonal Variations** - Same environment, different seasons

### Handling Zenith and Nadir

**Zenith (Top):**
- Use sky HDRI
- Or painted ceiling
- Or procedural sky
- Less critical, but should look good

**Nadir (Bottom):**
- Clean floor texture
- Or grass/ground
- Hide camera rig
- Can place subtle logo here
