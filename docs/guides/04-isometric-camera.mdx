## Understanding Isometric Projection

### What is Isometric?

**Isometric** means "equal measure" - parallel lines stay parallel and measurements along each axis are equally scaled. Unlike perspective cameras, objects don't get smaller with distance.

**Key Differences:**

| Perspective Camera | Orthographic (Isometric) Camera |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Objects shrink with distance | Objects stay same size |
| Parallel lines converge | Parallel lines stay parallel |
| Natural to human eye | Technical/stylized look |
| Depth of field | No depth of field |

**When to use Isometric:**
- Game art (strategy games, RPGs)
- Technical drawings
- Architecture diagrams
- Pixel art sprites
- Board game assets

---

## The 7 Projection Presets

---

### 2. Game 4:3 (19.471° tilt)

**Best For:** Less extreme angle, more "overhead" feel
**Characteristics:**
- 4:3 ratio (gentler than 2:1)
- Lower tilt = more top-down view
- Good for tactical/strategy games
**Examples:** Classic RTS games

---

### 3. True Isometric (35.264° tilt, 45° rotation)

**Best For:** Traditional technical drawings, classic game art
**Characteristics:**
- All three axes equally foreshortened
- 35.264° tilt (arctan(1/√2))
- 45° horizontal rotation
- The "mathematically correct" isometric
**Examples:** Classic isometric RPGs, technical illustrations

---

### 4. Dimetric (30° tilt)

**Best For:** Variation on isometric, slightly different feel
**Characteristics:**
- 30° tilt angle
- Two axes equally scaled, third different
- Popular in some game engines
**Examples:** Alternative to true isometric

---

### 5. Military (90° tilt)

**Best For:** Floor plans, top-down views, maps
**Characteristics:**

- Full control over projection angle
- Experiment with non-standard views
**Examples:** Stylized art, custom game engines

---

## Understanding the Settings

**Where to find:** Select `Isometric_Controller` → **Object Properties** tab → **"Isometric Camera Settings"** panel

**✨ New:** Settings now update in real-time! Change any property and the viewport updates immediately.

### 📐 Projection Type

Dropdown menu with 7 presets:
- **Game 2:1** - 26.565° tilt for 2:1 pixel art
- **Game 4:3** - 30° tilt for 4:3 pixel art
- **True Isometric** - 35.264° tilt, mathematically correct
- **Dimetric** - 30° variant
- **Military** - Top-down 90° view
- **Cavalier** - 45° oblique projection
- **Custom** - Define your own angles (shows custom angle inputs)

**Tip:** Switch between presets instantly to compare views!

---

### 🔍 Ortho Scale

Controls zoom level (orthographic scale):
- **Smaller values** = zoomed in (tight framing)
- **Larger values** = zoomed out (wide view)
- **Default:** 10.0

**Important:** With orthographic cameras, you zoom by changing scale, not by moving closer!

**Examples:**
- **5.0** = Close-up (small object fills frame)
- **10.0** = Medium (character or furniture)
- **30.0** = Wide (building or large scene)

---

### Custom Angles (Only when Projection Type = Custom)

When **Custom** projection is selected, three additional angle inputs appear:

**Custom Rotation Z** (Degrees)
- Horizontal spin around Z-axis
- **0°** = Front
- **45°** = Diagonal
- **90°** = Side
- **180°** = Back

**Custom Tilt X** (Degrees)
- Vertical tilt (camera pitch)
- **0°** = Looking at horizon
- **35.264°** = Isometric-like
- **90°** = Top-down

**Custom Roll Y** (Degrees)
- Camera roll/banking (rarely used)
- **0°** = Level
- Usually keep at 0°

**Note:** Values are in degrees for easy adjustment. The addon handles radian conversion internally.

---

## Working with Custom Angles

**Good News:** Custom angle properties use **degrees** in the UI for easier adjustment!

The addon handles radian conversion internally - you don't need to calculate radians yourself.

**Quick Reference:**

| Degrees | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 0° | Front/Level |
| 30° | Shallow angle |
| 45° | Diagonal |
| 60° | Steep angle |
| 90° | Side/Top-down |
| 180° | Back/Upside-down |

**Tip:** Use whole number degrees for easy experimentation (15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### View looks wrong / Objects don't line up

**Check:**
- You're looking through camera (`Numpad 0`)
- Camera is in **Orthographic** mode (not Perspective)
  - Camera Properties → Type → Orthographic

**Solution:** Modifier should auto-set this, but verify in Camera Properties.

---

### Can't see my object / Everything is tiny

**Cause:** **Ortho Scale** is too large

**Solution:**
- Decrease **Ortho Scale** value
- Start with 10.0 and adjust

---

### Object is off-center

**Remember:** Move the **controller**, not the camera!
- Select `Isometric_Controller`
- Press `G` to move it
- Frame your scene

**Tip:** Camera angle is fixed to projection - controller position determines framing.

---

### Projection doesn't look correct

**Check:**
- **Projection Type** is set to desired preset (0-6)
- Try switching between presets to compare
- For Custom, verify angle values are in radians

---

### Depth of field doesn't work

**This is normal:** Orthographic cameras don't support depth of field.
**Workaround:** Use Mist Pass or compositor depth effects for fake DOF.

---
