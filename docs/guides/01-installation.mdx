# Installation Guide

This guide walks you through installing the **PE Camera Rigs** addon in Blender. The process takes just a few minutes and uses Blender's built-in addon manager.

---

## Requirements

Before installing, ensure you meet these requirements:

- **Blender Version:** 4.0.0 or newer
- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Addon File:** `pe_camera_rigs.zip` (obtain from GitHub releases or build from source)

**Note:** This addon is specifically designed for Blender 4.0+ and may not work correctly on older versions.

---

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Download the Addon

**Option A: Download from GitHub Releases** (Recommended)

1. Visit the [GitHub Releases page]
2. Download the latest `pe_camera_rigs_vX.X.X.zip` file
3. **Do not unzip the file** - Blender requires the `.zip` format

**Option B: Build from Source**

If you have the source code, see the [Packaging Guide](./00-packaging_up.mdx) to create the `.zip` file.

### Step 2: Open Blender Preferences

1. **Launch Blender** (version 4.0 or newer)
2. Go to **`Edit`** → **`Preferences`** (or `Blender` → `Preferences` on macOS)
3. Click the **`Add-ons`** tab in the left sidebar

![Blender Preferences - Add-ons Tab](/docs/images/blender-preferences-addons.png)

### Step 3: Install the Addon

1. Click the **`Install...`** button in the top-right corner
2. In the file browser, navigate to your downloaded `pe_camera_rigs.zip` file
3. **Select the file** and click **`Install Add-on`**

**Important:** Install the `.zip` file directly - do not extract it first.

### Step 4: Enable the Addon

1. After installation, Blender will automatically filter to show the new addon
2. Find **"PE Camera Rigs"** in the list
   - If the list is filtered, you can search for "camera" or "PE" in the search box
3. **Check the checkbox** next to the addon name to enable it

![PE Camera Rigs Enabled](/docs/images/addon-enabled.png)

**Success!** You should see:

- A checkmark next to "PE Camera Rigs"
- No error messages in red text below the addon entry

### Step 5: Verify Installation

To confirm the addon is working:

1. **Open or create a new Blender project**
2. In the **3D Viewport**, press **`N`** to open the sidebar (if it's hidden)
3. Look for the **"PE Cams"** tab at the top of the sidebar
4. Click it to reveal the camera rig panels

You should see panels for:

- Orbit Camera
- Isometric Camera
- VR180 Professional Workflow
- VR360 Mono Professional Workflow

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "PE Cams" tab doesn't appear in sidebar

**Solutions:**

1. Press `N` to toggle the sidebar if it's hidden
2. Check the addon is **enabled** (checkbox is checked in Preferences)
3. Restart Blender after enabling the addon
4. Check the **System Console** for Python errors:
   - Windows: `Window` → `Toggle System Console`
   - macOS/Linux: Launch Blender from Terminal to see errors

### Problem: "Module not a valid addon" error during installation

**Cause:** Incorrect zip file structure.

**Solution:**

- The zip file must contain the `pe_camera_rigs` folder at its root level
- Download the official release or rebuild following the [Packaging Guide](./00-packaging_up.mdx)
- Do not try to install a zip of the entire repository

### Problem: Addon appears but buttons don't work

**Solutions:**

1. Check the **System Console** for error messages
2. Verify you're running **Blender 4.0 or newer** (`Help` → `About Blender`)
3. Try disabling and re-enabling the addon
4. If the issue persists, report it on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ianworthington/blender-camera-rigs-addon/issues)

### Problem: Can't find the addon in the list after installation

**Solutions:**

1. **Clear the search filter** - look for an 'X' button next to the search box
2. **Filter by category** - select "Camera" from the category dropdown
3. **Scroll down** - the addon may not be at the top of the list
4. **Check "Community" tab** - ensure you're not filtering to "Official" addons only

### Problem: Installation fails with "Permission denied"

**Cause:** Blender doesn't have write access to its addons folder.

**Solutions:**

- **Windows:** Run Blender as Administrator (right-click → "Run as administrator")
- **macOS/Linux:** Check permissions on `~/.config/blender/4.x/scripts/addons/`
- Install to user addons folder instead of system folder

---

## Addon Preferences

After installation, you can configure addon-wide settings:

1. In **Preferences → Add-ons**, find "PE Camera Rigs"
2. **Expand the addon entry** (click the arrow on the left)
3. Configure available settings:
   - **Output Path:** Default directory for rendered files
   - **Spatial Media Tool Path:** Path to Google's spatial media metadata injector (for VR workflows)

![Addon Preferences](/docs/images/addon-preferences.png)

**Note:** These preferences are optional. The addon will work with default settings.

## Updating the Addon

When a new version is released:

### Method 1: Remove and Reinstall (Recommended)

2. Find "PE Camera Rigs" and click the **Remove** button
3. **Restart Blender**
4. Follow the installation steps above with the new `.zip` file

### Method 2: Overwrite Installation

1. Install the new `.zip` file using `Install...` button
2. Blender will ask if you want to **overwrite** the existing addon
3. Click **OK** to overwrite
4. **Restart Blender** to load the new version

**Important:** Always restart Blender after updating to ensure the new code is loaded.

---

## Uninstalling

To completely remove the addon:

1. Go to **`Edit`** → **`Preferences`** → **`Add-ons`**
2. Find "PE Camera Rigs" in the list
3. **Uncheck the checkbox** to disable it
4. Click the **Remove** button
5. Restart Blender

**Note:** Any rigs you created in your scenes will remain, but the addon panels and operators will no longer be available.

---

## System Console (Debugging Tool)

If you encounter issues, the **System Console** shows detailed error messages:

**Windows:**

- `Window` → `Toggle System Console`
- A black console window will open showing Python output

**macOS:**

- Launch Blender from Terminal: `/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender`
- Errors will appear in the Terminal window

**Linux:**

- Launch Blender from terminal: `blender`
- Errors will appear in the same terminal

Look for lines starting with `Error:`, `Traceback`, or mentioning `pe_camera_rigs`.
