---

## Installation Issues

### Addon doesn't appear in preferences after installation

**Solutions:**
1. Verify zip file structure:
   - Must contain `pe_camera_rigs/` folder at root
   - NOT `src/pe_camera_rigs/` or loose files
2. Check Blender version is 4.0+
3. Look in "Community" addons (not "Official")
4. Search for "PE" or "camera" in addon list
5. Try installing again (remove old version first)

---

### "Module not a valid addon" error

**Cause:** Incorrect zip structure

**Solution:**
- Download official release from GitHub
- Or rebuild zip from `src/` directory
- See [Packaging Guide](./packaging.mdx) for developers

---

### Installation succeeds but addon won't enable

**Check System Console** for errors:
- Windows: `Window` → `Toggle System Console`
- macOS/Linux: Launch Blender from Terminal

**Common causes:**
- Missing Python dependencies (rare)
- Conflicting addon
- Corrupt .blend startup file

**Solutions:**
- Check console for specific error
- Try in factory settings: `blender --factory-startup`
- Report issue with console output

---

## UI/Panel Issues

### "PE Cams" tab doesn't appear in sidebar

**Solutions:**
1. Press `N` to show sidebar (if hidden)
2. Check addon is **enabled** (checkbox checked)
3. Restart Blender after enabling
4. Verify you're in 3D Viewport (not other editor)
5. Check System Console for errors

---

### Panels are empty or buttons missing

**Causes:**
- Property registration failed
- Version mismatch
- Incomplete installation

**Solutions:**
1. Disable and re-enable addon
2. Restart Blender
3. Reinstall addon (remove old version first)
4. Check System Console for Python errors

---

### Addon panels disappeared after Blender restart

**Check:**
- Addon is still enabled in Preferences
- No Blender update changed addon compatibility

**Solution:**
- Re-enable addon if unchecked
- Reinstall if problem persists

---

## Orbit Camera Issues

### Camera doesn't rotate

**Check:**
1. Animation is playing (`Spacebar`)
2. **Duration** is not zero in modifier
3. **Speed Multiplier** is not zero
4. Timeline end frame > start frame

**Solution:**
- Set Duration to 240
- Set Speed Multiplier to 1.0
- Play animation

---

### Camera rotates but very slowly

**Causes:**
- Duration too high
- Speed Multiplier too low

**Solutions:**
- Decrease **Duration** (try 120)
- Increase **Speed Multiplier** (try 2.0)

---

### Camera is too close/far from object

**Solution:**
- Select `Orbit_Controller`
- Adjust **Orbit Radius** in Modifier Properties
- Smaller = closer, Larger = farther

---

### Can't see camera view

**Solutions:**
- Press `Numpad 0` to look through camera
- Select camera → `View` → `Cameras` → `Set Active Camera`
- Check camera isn't hidden (eye icon in Outliner)

---

### Object is off-center in frame

**If no target set:**
- Move object to world origin (0, 0, 0)
- Or adjust `Orbit_Controller` position

**If target is set:**
- Verify target object selected in modifier
- Check target's origin point: `Object` → `Set Origin` → `Origin to Geometry`

---

### Animation not smooth

**Solutions:**
- Set **Easing** to **1 (In+Out)**
- Check keyframe interpolation if you manually keyframed
- Increase timeline frame rate preview

---

## Isometric Camera Issues

### View looks wrong / Not isometric

**Check:**
1. Looking through camera (`Numpad 0`)
2. Camera is **Orthographic** (not Perspective)
   - Camera Properties → Type → Orthographic
3. **Projection Type** set correctly (0-6)

**Solution:**
- Modifier should auto-set, but verify Camera Properties

---

### Can't see objects / Everything is tiny

**Cause:** **Ortho Scale** too large

**Solutions:**
- Decrease **Ortho Scale**
- Start with 10.0 and adjust
- Remember: Ortho scale controls zoom, not distance!

---

### Object is off-center

**Remember:** Move the **controller**, not the camera!
- Select `Isometric_Controller`
- Press `G` to move
- Camera angle stays fixed

---

### Projection doesn't match expected angles

**Check:**
- **Projection Type** value (0-6)
- Try switching presets to compare
- For Custom (6), verify angles are in radians

---

### Can't find Isometric settings / Where are the controls?

**Location Changed in v1.1:**

Settings are now in **Object Properties** (not Modifier Properties):

1. Select `Isometric_Controller`
2. Look for **Object Properties** tab (orange square icon)
3. Scroll down to **"Isometric Camera Settings"** panel
4. Edit properties here - updates happen in real-time!

**Note:** You can still see the modifier in Modifier Properties, but editing there is not recommended.

---

### Isometric properties don't update viewport

**Symptoms:**
- Changed Projection Type but view doesn't change
- Adjusted Ortho Scale but zoom stays same
- Custom angles don't affect camera

**Causes:**
1. **Wrong object selected** - Must select `Isometric_Controller`, not the camera
2. **Editing modifier directly** - Use Object Properties instead
3. **Viewport not refreshing** (rare, known Blender limitation)

**Solutions:**
1. Verify you're editing properties in **Object Properties** panel
2. Select `Isometric_Controller` object (not camera)
3. If still not updating, try:
   - Press `Numpad 0` to refresh camera view
   - Switch to another viewport and back
   - Save and reload file (forces update)

**Known Limitation:**
There's a rare Blender issue ([#87006](https://developer.blender.org/T87006)) where geometry node modifier updates may not trigger viewport refresh. If you experience persistent issues, please report with your Blender version.

---

### Depth of field doesn't work

**This is normal:** Orthographic cameras don't support DOF

**Workaround:**
- Use Mist Pass for depth
- Fake DOF in compositor

---

## VR Workflow Issues

### Step 2 render fails partway through

**Solutions:**
1. **Check disk space** - EXR files are 5-20MB each!
2. Verify output path exists and is writable
3. Reduce samples if running out of RAM
4. **Resume:** Click button again (skips completed frames)

---

### Step 3 compositor setup fails

**Check:**
1. Step 2 completed successfully
2. EXR files exist in output folder
3. File paths are correct (use `//` for relative)
4. Scene hasn't been renamed

**Solution:**
- Verify output folder has .exr files
- Check console for specific error

---

### Step 4 video has wrong aspect ratio

**Expected:**
- VR180: 2:1 (e.g., 5120×2560)
- VR360: 2:1 (e.g., 5120×2560)

**Check:**
- Compositor scene render settings
- Aspect X and Y both = 1.0
- Resolution matches preset

---

### YouTube doesn't recognize VR format

**Cause:** Missing spatial metadata

**Solutions:**
1. Use `spatial-media` tool to inject metadata:
   ```bash
   python -m spatialmedia -i -s left-right vr180_final.mp4 vr180_final_youtube.mp4
   ```
2. Verify:
   - Video codec is H.264
   - 2:1 aspect ratio preserved
   - Filename has no special characters

---

### VR180 stereo alignment looks wrong

**Check:**
- IPD is 63mm (standard)
- Cameras equidistant from rig
- No manual camera edits after creation

**Solution:**
- Delete rig and recreate
- Don't manually adjust cameras!

---

### Colors look washed out in VR output

**Check:**
- Color Management in compositor scene
- Output color space (sRGB vs. Filmic)

**Solutions:**
- Add color correction nodes in compositor
- Increase saturation slightly
- Adjust contrast

---

## Rendering Issues

### Render is too slow

**Hardware:**
1. Enable GPU rendering:
   - `Preferences` → `System` → `Cycles Render Device`
   - Select CUDA/OptiX (NVIDIA) or Metal (Mac)
2. Use multiple GPUs if available

**Settings:**
1. Reduce samples (start with 32)
2. Enable denoising
3. Lower resolution for tests
4. Use Adaptive Sampling
5. Reduce Light Path bounces

**Scene:**
1. Simplify geometry
2. Reduce subdivision levels
3. Use instances instead of duplicates
4. Disable volumetrics if not needed

---

### Render crashes / Out of memory

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce **Tile Size** (Render Properties)
2. Lower **Texture Resolution**
3. Reduce **Sample Count**
4. Close other applications
5. Render in parts (use Render Region)
6. Upgrade RAM if consistently short

---

### Denoiser not working

**Check:**
1. Denoising is enabled (Render Properties → Denoising)
2. Sufficient samples (minimum 16-32)
3. Using compatible denoiser:
   - OptiX (NVIDIA RTX GPUs)
   - OpenImageDenoise (any GPU/CPU)

**Solution:**
- Try different denoiser
- Increase samples if too noisy

---

### Renders look different from viewport

**Common causes:**
- Viewport render != final render engine
- Different sample counts
- Viewport clipping
- Hidden objects/layers

**Solutions:**
1. Match render engine (Cycles/Eevee)
2. Check render visibility (camera icon in Outliner)
3. Verify render layers
4. Test render small region first

---

## Performance Issues

### Viewport is laggy with rig active

**Interactive Rigs (Orbit/Isometric):**
- Geometry Nodes update in real-time
- Complex scenes may slow down

**Solutions:**
1. Hide non-essential objects
2. Use Collections to organize
3. Reduce viewport samples
4. Simplify geometry
5. Disable overlays temporarily

---

### Timeline playback is slow

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce viewport rendering quality
2. Hide complex objects
3. Use bbox display for heavy geometry
4. Reduce scene sample count
5. Play at lower fps for preview

---

### Modifier properties don't update viewport

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure Object Mode (not Edit Mode)
2. Scrub timeline to force update
3. Change another modifier value
4. Restart Blender if stuck

---

## General Issues

### Rig objects appear in render

**Controller objects:**
- Empties don't render (invisible in final)
- Template cameras are hidden
- If visible, check object render visibility

**Solution:**
- Disable render for object: Outliner → Camera icon

---

### Can't find created objects

**Check Outliner:**
1. Disable filters (funnel icon)
2. Enable "Show Hidden" (eye icon)
3. Search by name:
   - Orbit: `Orbit_Controller`
   - Isometric: `Isometric_Controller`
   - VR180: `VR180_Rig`
   - VR360: `VR360_Camera`

---

### Properties changed but nothing happens

**Check:**
1. Correct object selected
2. In Object Mode (not Edit Mode)
3. Looking at right modifier/property tab
4. Timeline updates if animated

---

### Error: "Node group not found"

**Cause:** Geometry node group missing/corrupted

**Solution:**
- Delete rig and recreate
- Don't manually edit node groups
- Report if recurring

---
